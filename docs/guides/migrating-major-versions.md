# Migrating Major Versions

In [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), a major version change (1.x.x to 2.x.x) occurs when we make incompatible API changes between releases. Simply put, sometimes we need to _break_ things to provide new major features or optimizations. If you find yourself upgrading to a new major version, you should expect additional work will need to be done to upgrade your codebase. This page contains documentation to help update code bases using an older version of Cornerstone:


## v2.x.x from v1.x.x

**TODO**

## v1.x.x from v0.9.x

**TODO**
